# FreestyleIoT_Project

For this project, i ve chosen to upgrade my existing IoT house >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoJDLW5kjLk and make it really internet of things by monitoring sensor outputs locally and via the BLYNK app >> https://blynk.io/ and control actuators locally and via BLYNK.

Link to the kitlist >> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GlvLmVtN7IZRM3OurWxvNwD4gjMKiJFMoon5G-sc7mI/edit?usp=sharing

The full Schematic can be found in this repository.

If you have a 3D printer and want to print your own house, you can find the STL files in this repository.
The STL files are still the IoT house version 1, i will update these files in the near future to have a cleaner finish.

i recommend a 0.2 layer height for the bigger parts and 0.1 for the smaller detail, no rafts, skirts, supports needed.

All ESP32 code i wrote for this project can be found in this repository as well.


Steps
_____________________________

1) Start by building the project following the schematics, You can also have a look at the Photos and screenshots (BLYNK app) 
in this repository and the demonstration video >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRs4ygz1CqU
2) Follow the instructions to set up BLYNK here >> https://blynk.io/en/getting-started , however i recommend setting up your own BLYNK server on a Raspberry Pi 4B, when using the CLOUD based server, there are limitations on how many widgets you will be able to use. Follow these instructions >> https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server
3) Open you Arduino IDE >> https://www.arduino.cc/en/software and first install the necessary board managers (ESP32) if not yet installed, follow the instructions on this page if Windows >> https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/  and this page if MacOS or Linux  https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-mac-and-linux-instructions/
4) Install following libraries from following links. In github, click on the Green "Code" button and then "Download zip". No need to unzip the file
You can then install these like follows >> In Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add . ZIP library and select the library youâ€™ve just downloaded.
I recommend to fully restart Arduino IDE after installing all libraries !!!
Wire.h >> https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 (This is a package af several neede libraries)
Adafruit_Sensor.h >> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor
Adafruit_BME280.h >> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library
WiFi.h >> https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 (This is a package af several neede libraries)
WiFiClient.h >> https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 (This is a package af several neede libraries)
BlynkSimpleEsp32.h >> https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library
Adafruit_SSD1306.h >> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306
Fonts/FreeSerif9pt7b.h >> https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/using-fonts
Adafruit_GFX.h >> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
Servo.h >> https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/ServoESP32
MFRC522.h >> https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid/archive/master.zip
SPI.h >> https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/SPI
5) Create your project in the BLYNK app. Because we use 2 x ESP32 for 1 project, we will need 2 Tokens to be generated by the app. Again, see the instructions on these sites for set this up >> https://blynk.io/en/getting-started and >> https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server when using your own local server.
5) Make the necessary changes in both codes to get connected to your Wi-Fi access point and the correct BLYNK server and Token >>




6) Now its time to upload the codes to the ESP32s. Upload "IoT_House_ESP32_BLYNK_ACCESS_CONTROL.ino" to the first ESP32 and "IoT_House_ESP32_CENTRAL_HEATER_GAS_Detection_FINAL.ino" to the second one. See this video for uploading code to the ESP32 using Arduino IDE, make sure that the needed drivers are installed for your COM port >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6l259vEt7k and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XX6fwdxO9Q

 

7) If both codes got uploaded without errors and
